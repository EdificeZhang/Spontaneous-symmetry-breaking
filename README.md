# Spontaneous-symmetry-breaking
Spontaneous symmetry breaking is one of the beautiful phenomenas of theoritical physics. It involves the creation of a true vacuum from a false vacuum. In early universe the higgs boson is supposed to get trapped in the true vacuum. Some other particles may sort of cause higgs boson to rise uphill to increase the potential. This is analogous to say mass is acquired by that interacting particle.This phenomena occours in superconductivity. Read more about [spontaneous symmetry breaking on wikipedia](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Spontaneous_symmetry_breaking).

I've used the potential of the type x^2 + x^4 which is the standerd mexican hat potential or the higgs potential. Both 2D and 3D version are done.
